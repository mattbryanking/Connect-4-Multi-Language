# Connect-4-Multi-Language
A collection of terminal-based Connect 4 games, created to explore features and structures of a variety of different languages. The game board sizes are configurable across all platforms, as are the win length conditions. 

## Swift: 
A general exploration of the language, including optionals, do/guard/defer keywords, and protocol-oriented programming. A full-length essay analyzing the features of Swift and their usefulness to the project is also included as a PDF.

## Kawa Scheme:
A deep dive into a purely functional language to broaden my experience and master things like recursion. A copy of Kawa Scheme is packaged alongside the project files.

## C:
Used to sharpen my skills with pointers and dynamic memory allocation. The entire game board is dynamically allocated onto the heap, with no leaks or out-of-bound reads/writes (tested with Valgrind).

## JavaScript: 
Provided experience with writing asynchronous code with I/O and callbacks, and incorporates both imperative and functional programming aspects.

## Ruby:
Incorporated Ruby-esque features like method chaining, along with each-loops rather than traditional for-loops.
